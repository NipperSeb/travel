            "My job is Head of the Charcuterie / Cheese Department. With all the richness of the products, you can always count on this profession to awaken your taste buds and bring conviviality. Anchored in the land but disrupted by the obsession with healthy eating, the traditional charcuterie market is experiencing a sharp decline in 2020. The overall market in volume at the end of October is at -2.9% and the mass distribution channels are losing market share for the benefit of specialists and direct sales. Our room for maneuver is narrow. Professionals in the trade are becoming increasingly rare, prices are at the highest and the average ticket is falling. (Effect of containment. Less guest, less purchase.). Despite this context, the attendance rate remains good, the cheese department is experiencing good growth and overall margins are preserved. In the near future, I want to use digital as a lever for development around 2 axes. Digital management assistance tools more specific to our business (health constraints and best practices) and digital communication tools to give authenticity to our products."

Motivated people paid at the minimum wage and part-time require a lot of pedagogy to train them to the many existing standards in our fields. We have to create a good atmosphere and maintain good cohesion between the teams. Listening, praising or picking up areas for improvement are part of my management. I must admit that today I am pleased with the professionalism of my colleagues. Some people will prefer collaborator to show their hierarchy, and although I respect this decision, I do not agree. The employment contract is sufficient for a good understanding of each person's role. No need to add more."

Today, customers are looking for authenticity and to meet this need, our products must be healthy, of French origin, with complete transparency. The Department Manager of tomorrow will have to know how to communicate on the drive, to highlight products selected by him on the site and to reassure the customer about the quality of this one in full transparency. And to succeed in this transformation, agri-food companies (small or large) will have to support us by communicating about their know-how."

In other words, it is a set of point-of-sale documents that describes everything that is put in place to ensure food hygiene and safety. Within my department, the most important documents are the HACCP notebooks and the product traceability notebooks. The Haccp makes it possible to carry out and record self-checks: reception, temperatures, cleaning / disinfection. The product traceability books will allow us to control the lifespan of the products offered for sale and also to monitor products from fork to plate. An annual audit and an inspection by an independent service ensure control of the PMS. The hygiene and quality audit follows IFS (International Feature Standard). Concretely, the requirements are represented by items spread over 4 activities: observation of good practices, observation of premises, measurements and questioning of staff."

Luckily, I have an opportunity. On the Le Bon Coin site, a staircase corresponds to my expectations. It will still be necessary to adjust its height and make the hopper. The staircase is new and consists of 2 parts. When I laid the plasterboard on the first floor, I had wooden posts in the corners to support the load of the stairs. First, I removed the old staircase, put in the missing tiling tiles and then installed the new hopper. Then I isolated and tackled the stairwell. A few stripes and a lick of paint. Then with the help of my friends, we installed this new staircase. Upstairs, before laying the floor for the threshold, I take the opportunity to make a small hopper for the passage of a tube for a stove. Here, I am ready to attack the new room."

And the products sold in DIY stores are not very pretty, nor very solid for my taste. While watching the advertisements on Le Bon Coin for several months, I came across a railing with the same design and the same essence as the installed staircase. You still have to pick it up in Carhaix in central Brittany. I love the region, but there in the middle of November in the rain and at night, you have to motivate yourself. When I get home, I prepare it for the new dimensions, ask a carpenter for a new post and sand it carefully. Then I fix it securely on the plasterboard (with a reinforcement provided for this purpose), modify a post to a corner post and install the brand new post. Install I have to plug the hopper. Inexpensive and pretty beech plywood will do the trick. The hardest part is detailing it so that it matches the shape of the staircase and then finally fixing it."

PHP is most often coupled with an Apache server although it can be installed on most HTTP servers such as IIS or nginx. This coupling makes it possible to retrieve information from a database, a file system (content of files and of the tree structure) or more simply data sent by the browser in order to be interpreted or stored for use. later.

Along with HTML and CSS technologies, JavaScript is sometimes considered one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web2. A large majority of websites use it3, and the majority of web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine4 to interpret it, regardless of security considerations that may arise if necessary. It is an object-to-prototype oriented language: the bases of the language and its main interfaces are provided by objects. However, unlike an object-oriented language, base objects are not instances of classes. Each base object (e.g. document or windows object) has its own model which will allow it to instantiate objects children using constructors using their properties. For example, the prototyping property will allow them to create custom heir objects. Thanks to source: Wikipedia"
